# Odin-Rock-Paper-Scissors

Rock paper scissors game made with html css and js   
This project made me realise how much i hate working with vanilla js and that react is way better.   
Here is the preview link : <a>https://nooorrrr.github.io/Odin-Rock-Paper-Scissors/<a>    
It might not be very responsive and the game goes on till infinity (i will fix that on day ... i promise)
