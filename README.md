# Odin-Rock-Paper-Scissors

Rock paper scissors game assignement of the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">the odin project</a> made with html css and js      
This project made me realise how much i hate working with vanilla js and that react is way better.     
Here is the preview link : <a href="https://nooorrrr.github.io/Odin-Rock-Paper-Scissors"> preview <a>       
It might not be very responsive and the game goes on till infinity (i will fix that on day ... i promise), but t works perfectly fine.
